You awaken to find yourself lying on the ground.
Except this time, your inspection of your surroundings reveals silver sand as far as the eye can see.
You look up to see a strange unfamiliar sky bathed in odd blues and purples.
In the sky, you see...
The moon?
No that can't be...
It looks more like the planet you should be on
You don't have time for confusion however,
You scan the horizon and see fog.
Standing, you scan the horizon a bit longer where you make out figures.
They're coming towards you.
A chime rings out in your head
You start to feel a numbness take hold of your body.
You must make a decision now.
The figures on the horizon are getting closer
And their outlines look horrifying
Intimidating
