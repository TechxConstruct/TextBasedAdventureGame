You continue to stare at the sky. Focusing on the moon in particular.
The moon still seems... Off.
You study the moon.
There's a bluish tint that is almost barely there.
You stare long enough for your eyes to protest.
You blink...
Your breath gets caught in your throat
A trick of the mind?
It looks like the moon popped back into it's previous location...
You sit up abruptly
Panic growing
The moon is...
Shimmering.
The bluish tint becoming more profound.
More in tense.
The hazy feeling you experienced before is back.
Before long that hazy feeling becomes an intense pain.
You pass out.
